FORKED(original code was a python interface)

The purpose of forking this repository is to create in essence a drone I can command with my voice, through microphone setup I would to with the use of two Network Interface Adapters have one connected to the drone relaying my request back and forward from the drone and the other connected to the net sending these voice requests to a google API with the Speech-to-Text API so that I can in effect use these returns as inputs to command the drone

DISCLAIMER

I do not own a Tello. This code and documentation is based on the Tello SDK
documentation as of 3/19/2018.

WHAT THE BLEEP IS THIS

A Python interface for the Ryze Tello drone.

The tello module provides a Tello class, which interacts with the Tello API.

The Tello has an IP of 192.168.10.1. The device sending commands must be
connected to the Tello WiFi network and have an IP in the 192.168.10.0/24
range.

CREATE A MAGIC TELLO OBJECT

Tello objects require a minimum of 2 parameters to initialize, the local IP
address and port to bind.

Ex. drone = tello.Tello('192.168.10.2', 8888)

Methods that require distance or speed parameters expect feet or MPH. Include
parameter imperial=False for meters and KPH.

Ex. drone = tello.Tello('192.168.10.2', 8888, imperial=False)

If you send a command to the Tello and it doesn't respond within .3 seconds, a
RuntimeError is raised. You may specify the number of seconds to wait with the
timeout parameter.

Ex. drone = tello.Tello('192.168.10.2', 8888, imperial=False, timeout=.5)

When you initialize a Tello object, it attempts to connect to the Tello and
enter command mode. If this fails, a RuntimeError is raised.

DO VARIOUS THINGS

Once initialized, a number of methods are available to send commands to the
Tello. It will respond with 'OK', 'FALSE' or a numeric value, which the methods
return.

These methods do what you'd expect. Responses are 'OK' or 'FALSE'.

Tello.takeoff()
Tello.land()

Methods that perform vertical or horizontal movements require a single
parameter, distance. Responses are 'OK' or 'FALSE'.

The unit of distance is feet or meters. The SDK accepts distances of 1 to 500
centimeters. Realistically, this translates to .1 - 5 meters or .7 - 16.4 feet.

Tello.move_forward(distance)
Tello.move_backward(distance)
Tello.move_right(distance)
Tello.move_left(distance)
Tello.move_up(distance)
Tello.move_down(distance)

Methods that rotate require a single parameter, degrees. The SDK accepts values
from 1 to 360. Responses are 'OK' or 'FALSE'.

Tello.rotate_cw(degrees)
Tello.rotate_ccw(degrees)

The method to set speed requires a single parameter, speed. Responses are 'OK'
or 'FALSE'.

The unit of speed is KPH or MPH. The SDK accepts speeds from 1 to 100
centimeters/second. Realistically, this translates to .1 to 3.6 KPH or .1 to 
2.2 MPH.

Tello.set_speed(speed)

The method to flip requires a single parameter, direction. The SDK accepts 'l',
'r', 'f', 'b', 'lf', 'lb', 'rf' or 'rb'. Responses are 'OK' or 'FALSE'.

Tello.flip(direction)

Methods that retrieve information from the Tello take no parameters. Responses
are numeric values.

Get current speed in KPH or MPH:
Tello.get_speed()

Get percent battery life remaining:
Tello.get_battery()

Get elapsed flight time in seconds:
Tello.get_flight_time()

DO THE HOKEY POKEY

Put it all together, and you might do something like this.

import tello
import time

drone = tello.Tello('192.168.10.2', 8888)

drone.takeoff()
time.sleep(5)

drone.set_speed(2)
time.sleep(1)

drone.move_up(3)
time.sleep(5)

drone.move_forward(10)
time.sleep(10)

drone.rotate_cw(180)
time.sleep(5)

drone.move_forward(10)
time.sleep(10)

drone.land()

print 'Flight time: %s' % drone.get_flight_time()

TALKATIVE DRONE

Included as well with the tello python interface is a speech.py file showing a typical setup for the mentioned interface. This example also can be further modified to enable fully voice controlled drone flight !!Please not that this functionality requires an internet connection!!
